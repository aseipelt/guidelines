Describes the number of segments into which a dashed or dotted line may be divided, or
          the number of "peaks" of a wavy line; a pair of space-separated values (minimum and
          maximum, respectively) provides a range between which a rendering system-supplied value
          may fall, while a single value indicates a fixed amount of space; that is, the minimum and
          maximum values are equal.
