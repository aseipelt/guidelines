A count of measures plus a beat location, i.e., (\+|-)?[0-9]+m\+[0-9]+(\.?[0-9]*)?. The
      measure count is the number of barlines crossed by the event, while the beat location is a
      timestamp expressed as a beat with an optional fractional part. The measure number must be in
      the range of preceding measures to the number of remaining measures. A value with a positive
      measure number, such as "1m+3", indicates a point in the following measure, while a value with
      a negative measure number, such as "-1m+3", marks a point in the preceding measure. The beat
      number must be in the range from 0 to the numerator of the time signature plus 1. For example,
      in 6/8 the beat number must be within the range from 0 (the left barline) to 7 (the right
      barline). A value with a measure number of "0", such as "0m+2", indicates a point within the
      current measure.
