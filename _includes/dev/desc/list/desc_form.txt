Used to indicate the format of a list. In a "simple" list, li
          elements are not numbered or bulleted. In a "marked" list, the sequence of the list items
          is not critical, and a bullet, box, dash, or other character is displayed at the start of
          each item. In an "ordered" list, the sequence of the items is
          important, and each li is lettered or numbered. Style sheet
          functions should be used to specify the mark or numeration system for each li.
