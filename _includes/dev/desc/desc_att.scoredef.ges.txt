Gestural domain attributes for scoreDef. The values set in these attributes act as
      score-wide defaults for attributes that are not set in descendant elements. For example, the
      grace attribute value here applies to all the grace attribute values in the score (or, more
      accurately, until the next scoreDef element) without having to
      individually set each note's grace attribute value. The midi.* attributes function as default
      values when creating sounding output. The tune.* attributes provide the capability of
      recording a tuning reference pitch.
