Visual domain attributes. If the bulge or bezier attributes are present, the bend should
      be rendered as a curve. Otherwise, it should be rendered using lines. The ho and vo attributes
      describe the visual offset of the entire rendered bend. The endho, endvo and startho, startvo
      attribute pairs may be used to encode start and end points relative to their programmatic
      placement. For exact placement of the endpoints of the bend, use the x and y
      attributes.
