Visual offset attributes. Some items may have their location recorded in terms of pairs of
      offsets from their programmatically-determined location. The startho and endho attributes
      record the horizontal offsets of the start and end points of the item, respectively.
      Similarly, the startvo and endvo attributes record the vertical offsets of the start and end
      points of the item. The startto and endto attributes hold timestamp offsets, the most common
      use of which is as alternatives to the ho attributes.
