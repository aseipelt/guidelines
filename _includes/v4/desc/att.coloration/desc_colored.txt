Indicates this feature is 'colored'; that is, it is a participant in a change in
          rhythmic values. In mensural notation, coloration is indicated by colored notes (red,
          black, etc.) where void notes would otherwise occur. In CMN, coloration is indicated by an
          inverse color; that is, the note head is void when it would otherwise be filled and vice
          versa.
