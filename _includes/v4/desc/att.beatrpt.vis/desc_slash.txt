Indicates the number of slashes required to render the appropriate beat repeat symbol.
          When a single beat consisting of a single note or chord is repeated, the repetition symbol
          is a single thick, slanting slash; therefore, the value '1' should be used. When the beat
          is divided into even notes, the following values should be used: 4ths or 8ths=1, 16ths=2,
          32nds=3, 64ths=4, 128ths=5. When the beat is comprised of mixed duration values, the
          default rendition is 2 slashes and 2 dots.
