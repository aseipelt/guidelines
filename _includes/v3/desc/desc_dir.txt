(directive) – An instruction expressed as a combination of text and symbols — such
as
segno and coda symbols, fermatas over a bar line, etc., typically above, below, or
between
staves, but not on the staff — that is not encoded elsewhere in more specific elements,
like
&lt;tempo&gt; or &lt;dynam&gt;.
