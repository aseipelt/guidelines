Used to indicate the format of a list. In a "simple" list, 
elements are not numbered or bulleted. In a "marked" list, the sequence of the list
items is not critical, and a bullet, box, dash, or other character is displayed at
the
start of each . In an "ordered" list, the sequence of the
items is important, and each  is lettered or numbered. Style
sheet functions should be used to specify the mark or numeration system for each .
