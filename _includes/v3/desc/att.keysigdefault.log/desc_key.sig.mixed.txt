Mixed key signatures, e.g. those consisting of a mixture of flats and sharps (Read,
p. 143, ex. 9-39), and key signatures with unorthodox placement of the accidentals
(Read, p. 141) must be indicated by setting the key.sig attribute to 'mixed' and
providing explicit key signature information in the key.sig.mixed attribute or in
the
&lt;keySig&gt; element. It is intended that key.sig.mixed contain a series of tokens
with each token containing pitch name, accidental, and octave, such as 'a4 c5s e5f'
that
indicate what key accidentals should be rendered and where they should be placed.
