Used to describe tempo in terms of beats (often the meter signature denominator) per
minute, ala M.M. (Maezel's Metronome). Do not confuse this attribute with midi.bpm
or
midi.mspb. In MIDI, a beat is always defined as a quarter note, *not the numerator
of
the time signature or the metronomic indication*.
