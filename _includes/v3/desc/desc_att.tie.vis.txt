Visual domain attributes. The vo attribute is the vertical offset (from its normal
position) of the entire rendered tie. The startho, startvo, endho, and endvo attributes
describe the horizontal and vertical offsets of the start and end points of the tie
in terms
of staff interline distance; that is, in units of 1/2 the distance between adjacent
staff
lines. Startto and endto describe the start and end points in terms of time; that
is,
beats.
