Describes a curve as one or more pairs of values with respect to an imaginary line
connecting the starting and ending points of the curve. The first value captures a
distance to the left (positive value) or right (negative value) of the line, expressed
in virtual units. The second value of each pair represents a point along the line,
expressed as a percentage of the line's length. N.B. An MEI virtual unit (VU) is half
the distance between adjacent staff lines.
