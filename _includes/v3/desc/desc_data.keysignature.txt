Key signature may be indicated by a value showing where the key is in the circle of
fifths. Mixed key signatures, e.g. those consisting of a mixture of flats and sharps,
and
key signatures with unorthodox placement of the accidentals (Read, p. 143) must be
indicated
by setting the key.sig attribute to 'mixed' and providing explicit key signature information
in the key.sig.mixed attribute.
