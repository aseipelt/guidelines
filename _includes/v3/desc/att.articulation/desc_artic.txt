Encodes the written articulation(s). Articulations are normally encoded in order
from the note head outward; that is, away from the stem. See additional notes at
att.vis.note. Only articulations should be encoded in the artic attribute; for example,
fingerings should be encoded using the &lt;fingering&gt; element.
