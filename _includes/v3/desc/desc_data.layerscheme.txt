Indicates how stems should be drawn when more than one layer is present and stem
directions are not indicated on the notes/chords themselves. '1' indicates that there
is
only a single layer on a staff. '2o' means there are two layers with opposing stems.
'2f'
indicates two 'free' layers; that is, opposing stems will be drawn unless one of the
layers
has 'space'. In that case, stem direction in the remaining layer will be determined
as if
there were only one layer. '3o' and '3f' are analogous to '2o' and '2f' with three
layers
allowed.
