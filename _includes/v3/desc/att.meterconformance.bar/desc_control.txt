Indicates whether or not a bar line is "controlling"; that is, if it indicates a
point of alignment across all the parts. Bar lines within a score are usually
controlling; that is, they "line up". Bar lines within parts may or may not be
controlling. When applied to &lt;measure&gt;, this attribute indicates the nature of the
right barline but not the left.
