Used by staffDef and scoreDef to provide default values for attributes in the logical
domain related to mensuration. The tempus, prolatio, modusmaior, and modusminor attributes
(from the att.mensural.shared class) specify the relationship between the four principle
levels of note value, i.e., the long, breve, semibreve and minim, in mensural notation.
Modusminor describes the long-breve relationship, while tempus describes the
breve-semibreve, and prolatio the semibreve-minim relationship, respectively. Modusmaior
is
for the maxima-long relationship. The proport.* attributes describe augmentation or
diminution of the normal value of the notes in mensural notation.
