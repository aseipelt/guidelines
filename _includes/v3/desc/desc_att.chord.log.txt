Logical domain attributes for chord. The artic, dots, and dur attributes encode the
written articulations, augmentation dots, and duration values. The beam, fermata,
lv, slur,
syl, tie, and tuplet attributes may be used to indicate the attachment of these things
to
this chord. If visual information about these things needs to be recorded, then either
the
elements corresponding to these attributes or the attributes available in the att.vis.chord
class should be employed.
