i=initial, m=medial, t=terminal. Number is used to match endpoints of the slur when
slurs are nested or overlap, e.g. &lt;note slur='i1 i2'/&gt;&lt;note slur='t1'/&gt;&lt;note
slur='t2'/&gt; encodes the fact that two slurs begin on note 1, one which terminates
on note
2 and one which terminates on note 3.
