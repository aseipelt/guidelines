Mapping elements from the MEI metadata header to another descriptive system may help a repository harvest selected data from the MEI file to build a basic catalog record. For this purpose, the following attribute is provided on most elements occurring within {% include link elem="meiHead" %}:

{% include desc atts="att.bibl/analog" %}

The encoding system to which fields are mapped must be specified in **@analog**. When possible, subfields as well as fields should be specified, e.g., subfields within MARC fields.
