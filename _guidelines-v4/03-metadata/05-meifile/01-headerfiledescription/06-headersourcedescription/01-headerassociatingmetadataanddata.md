In the MEI header, the **@data** attribute may be used to associate metadata with related notational elements.

Similarly, in the body of the MEI document, the **@decls** attribute may be used to associate parts of the encoded text with related metadata.

The most useful associations of this type are between the bibliographic description of a source and the material taken from it.
