When the mensural module is included, **@dur** on {% include link elem="note" %}, {% include link elem="rest" %}, and other elements can take the following values:

- maxima
- longa
- brevis
- semibrevis
- minima
- semiminima
- fusa
- semifusa

Additionally, the **@dur** attribute can take on two other values when used within {% include link elem="rest" %} elements:
- 2B, for two-breve rests
- 3B, for three-breve rests

An example of the encoding of the music content of one staff (including both 2-breve and 3-breve rests) in *modus minor perfect* follows:
