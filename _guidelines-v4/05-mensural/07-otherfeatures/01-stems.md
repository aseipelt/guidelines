The characteristics of a note's stem can be encoded within the {% include link elem="note" %} element, using the attributes:

{% include desc atts="att.stems/stem.dir att.stems/stem.pos att.stems/stem.len att.stems/stem.x att.stems/stem.y" %}
<!-- Add att.stems/stem.form as the third one later on when this change gets accepted in the Mensural MEI module -->

PLACE-HOLDER FOR EXAMPLE OF ONE NOTE WITH ONE STEM: IMAGE & ITS ENCODING

Sometimes notes have two stems. In this case, the {% include link elem="stem" %} element can be used as a child of {% include link elem="note" %} to define the individual characteristics of each stem.
