Proportions can also be indicated within the {% include link elem="staffDef" %} element. The **@proport.num** and **@proport.numbase** attributes are available for encoding the numerator and the denominator of the proportion, respectively. There is also a {% include link elem="proport" %} element that can be used as an alternative, with the corresponding **@num** and **@numbase** attributes.
