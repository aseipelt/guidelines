Proportions can also be indicated within the {% include link elem="mensur" %} element. The **@num** and **@numbase** attributes are available for encoding the numerator and the denominator of the proportion, respectively. There is also a {% include link elem="proport" %} element that can be used as an alternative.

{% include desc elem="proport" %}
