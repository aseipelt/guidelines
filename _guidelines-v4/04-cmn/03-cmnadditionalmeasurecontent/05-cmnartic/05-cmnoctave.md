An indication that a passage should be performed one or more octaves above or below its written pitch is represented by the {% include link elem="octave" %} element.

{% include figure img="ExampleImages/octave-a-20100510.png" caption="Octave displacement" %}

Its **@dis** and **@dis.place** attributes record the amount and direction of displacement, respectively. The **@lform** attribute captures the appearance of the continuation line associated with the octave displacement. The starting point of the octave displacement may be indicated by either a **@tstamp**, **@tstamp.ges**, **@tstamp.real** or **@startid** attribute, while the ending point may be recorded by either a **@tstamp2**, **@dur**, **@dur.ges** or **@endid** attribute. It is a semantic error not to specify one starting-type attribute and one ending-type attribute.
