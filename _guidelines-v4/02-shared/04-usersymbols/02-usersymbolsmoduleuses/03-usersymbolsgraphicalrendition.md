Usersymbols can define the rendition of different elements in two ways. Some elements, for example {% include link elem="dir" %} and {% include link elem="tempo" %}, can have user symbol elements as content. In the following example, the content of {% include link elem="dir" %} is used to provide pictograms of percussion instruments.

{% include figure img="modules/usersymbols/percussion.png" caption="Indicating percussion instruments using pictograms" %}

The corresponding encoding would be as follows:
{% include mei example="usersymbols/usersymbols-sample348.xml" valid="true" %}

A number of elements can point to an internally-defined symbol for rendering using the **@altsym** attribute.

{% include figure img="modules/usersymbols/charpentier.png" caption="Different treble clef renditions as written by Charpentier (source: Journal of Seventeenth-Century Music, Volume 12, No. 1 (2006), figure 3)" %}

{% include figure img="" caption="Defining two staffs, each using its own treble clef shape" %}

Externally-defined symbols may be referenced using a **@glyphname** or **@glyphnum** attribute. Both attributes refer to Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL) characters. Other character sets must be treated as internally-defined character sets.

{% include figure img="" caption="Use of glyphname and glyphnum attributes" %}
