The elements below are used to capture the logical organization of musical notation:

{% include desc elem="staff" %}
{% include desc elem="layer" %}

The actual use of the {% include link elem="staff" %} and {% include link elem="layer" %} elements depends on the repertoire and historical context of the source material. For details on their use in Common Western Notation, please refer to chapter {% include link id="cmnMeasures" %}. For mensural notation, see chapter {% include link id="mensuralData" %}, and for neumatic notation, chapter {% include link id="neumes" %}.
