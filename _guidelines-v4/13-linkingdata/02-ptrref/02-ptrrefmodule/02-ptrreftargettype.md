The **@targettype** attribute allows the target resource to be characterized using any convenient classification scheme or typology. This is often useful when the target requires special processing, e.g., for display purposes. The pointers in the examples below may be formatted differently, e.g., the bibliographic citation may result in special typography while the pointer to the audio file may be used to embed an audio player:

{% include mei example="ptrRef/ptrRef-sample341.txt" valid="" %}
{% include mei example="ptrRef/ptrRef-sample342.txt" valid="" %}
