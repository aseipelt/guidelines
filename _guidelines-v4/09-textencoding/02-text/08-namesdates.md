This chapter describes the MEI module used for the encoding of names (names of persons or corporations/organizations) or descriptive phrases for styles, periods or geographical indications. In section {% include link id="sharedNamesNumbersDates" %} it was noted that the elements provided in the core module allow an encoder to specify that a given text segment is a proper noun. The elements provided by the present module allow the encoder to supply a detailed sub-structure for such proper nouns, and to distinguish explicitly between persons and organizations, and between stylistic, periodical or geographical indications.

The chapter begins by discussing the elements provided for the encoding of names ({% include link elem="name" %}) and dates ({% include link elem="date" %}) in general and finishes by addressing more specific elements for corporate names ({% include link elem="corpName" %}), geographic names ({% include link elem="geogName" %}), period names ({% include link elem="periodName" %}), personal names ({% include link elem="persName" %}) and style names ({% include link elem="styleName" %}). In general it is recommended to use standardized forms of proper nouns and to record the names and web-accessible locations of the controlled vocabularies used. There are several commonly-referenced authority files, especially for geographical, organizational and personal names, such as the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND), the Library of Congress Authorities, the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), and the MARC code list for relators. Recommendations on which standards could be used can be found in the descriptions of the individual elements.
