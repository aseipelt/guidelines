This chapter describes the use of elements in MEI for linking and referencing. This includes the elements, models, and attributes that are part of the MEI.ptrref module. This module contains declarations, techniques and approaches to establish references within a single MEI document, or to link out from one MEI document to another or to another external source. This chapter also addresses possibilities to link into an MEI document from external sources which makes MEI highly interoperable and serviceable in the context of Linked (Open) Data approaches.
