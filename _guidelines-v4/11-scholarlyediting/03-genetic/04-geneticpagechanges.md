In genetic editions, it may also be of interest to trace when pages are added and / or removed from manuscripts. The general information about pages can be encoded using the {% include link elem="foliaDesc" %} element, as described in {% include link id="foliadesc" %}. It is possible to wrap the elements used there, including {% include link elem="patch"%} and {% include link elem="cutout"%} with editorial markup like {% include link elem="add" %} and {% include link elem="del" %}. These elements can then be used to reference {% include link elem="genState" %} as described in {% include link id="geneticReferences" %}.
