This chapter describes the encoding of indications of harmony ocurring within a music text, e.g., chord names, tablature grids, figured bass, or signs for harmonic analysis, and the methods by which these indications can be connected with their interpretations. For encoder-supplied analysis of intervallic content, please see chapter {% include link id="analysis" %}.
