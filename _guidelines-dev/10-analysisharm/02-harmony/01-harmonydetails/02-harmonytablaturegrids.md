The **@pos** attribute on {% include link elem="chordDef" %}, the **@fing** and **@fret** attributes on {% include link elem="chordMember" %}, and the {% include link elem="barre" %} element child of {% include link elem="chordDef" %} are provided in order to create displayable and performable chord tablature grids for guitar and other fretted string instruments. The fret at which a finger should be placed is recorded in the **@fret** attribute, while **@fing** indicates which finger, if any, should be used to play an individual string. The values x and o are used to indicate muffled and open strings, respectively.

The {% include link elem="chordDef" %} element may contain {% include link elem="barre" %} sub-elements when a single finger is used to stop multiple strings. Here the **@fret** attribute gives the fret position at which the barre should be created, while the **@startid** and **@endid** attributes are used to indicate the {% include link elem="chordMember" %} elements on which the barre starts and finishes.
