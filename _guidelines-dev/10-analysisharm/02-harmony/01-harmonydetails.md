On the most basic level, chords in the musical text can be encoded using the {% include link elem="chord" %} element:

{% include desc elem="chord" %}

Additional information on the use of the {% include link elem="chord" %} element is available in {% include link id="sharedBasicEvents" %} and {% include link id="cmnNotesChords" %}.

With only this kind of markup, harmonic information is implicit in the notes themselves. The elements and attributes of this module, however, provide for the encoding of explicit indications of harmony, such as chord symbols, tablature grids, figured bass signs, and the symbols of harmonic analysis like Roman numerals and their interpretation.
