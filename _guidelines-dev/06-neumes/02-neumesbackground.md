Neume encoding in MEI was initially developed as part of the Hildegard von Bingen project at the University of T체bingen. MEI was chosen as the basic representation format after a [comparison of existing music encoding formats](http://www.dimused.uni-tuebingen.de/tuebingen_phase1_e.php){:.link_ref}. The initial work on this module was performed by Gregor Schr채der [(Ein XML-Datenformat zur Repr채sentation kritischer Musikedition unter besonderer Ber체cksichtigung von Neumennotation)](http://www.dimused.uni-tuebingen.de/downloads/studienarbeit.pdf){:.link_ref}, supervised by Prof. Stefan Morent.

This module was originally developed against version 1.8 of the MEI DTD, and has subsequently been translated to the TEI ODD schema.
