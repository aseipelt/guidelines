Apart from music and text, musical documents, both historical and contemporary, may also contain material in graphical or tabular format. In such materials, details of layout and presentation may also be of comparatively greater significance or complexity than they are for running text. Although some types of graphical material can be represented directly with markup, it is more common practice to include such information by using a reference to an external entity (typically a URL) encoded in a suitable graphical format.

The module defined by this chapter defines special purpose ‘container’ elements that can be used to encapsulate occurrences of such data within an MEI-conformant document in a portable way. Specific recommendations for the encoding of figures, figure descriptions and graphics as well as tables with their sub-elements {% include link elem="tr" %}, {% include link elem="td" %} and {% include link elem="th" %} are provided at the beginnig of this chapter. As there exists a wide variety of different graphic formats, a short list of formats that are widely used at the present time, is given in section {% include link id="figTableImages" %}. Each one includes a very brief description. The chapter closes with attribute and model classes which are defined by the module.

The module described in this chapter makes available the following components:
