This chapter describes methods for encoding textual content with MEI. Textual information on scores has several different uses, although some text is closer to music notation than other kinds. For example, tempo marks, directives and lyrics are directly related to the functionality of the notated music and are, therefore, described in other chapters (see for example {% include link id="lyricsDesc" %} and {% include link id="sharedTextDirectives" %}). This chapter, on the other hand, focuses on the text that accompanies the score, i.e., paratext (prefatory material, title pages, back matter, appendices, etc.), titles, prose, poetry, etc.

Most of the elements described here take inspiration from encoding formats that deal primarily with text, such as HTML and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). These elements are provided to encode relatively basic textual information. For deeper encoding of text, these Guidelines recommend consideration of other text-specific encoding formats with embedded MEI markup.
