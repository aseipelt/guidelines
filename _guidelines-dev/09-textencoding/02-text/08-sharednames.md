The {% include link elem="name" %} element may be used to mark up portions of a text that function as name.

{% include desc elem="name" %}

The {% include link elem="name" %} element is intended for generic applications and may be used to identify any named entity, such as a person, item, application, place, etc. Sometimes, however, a more specific encoding is desired, identifying the type of entity by using dedicated elements. MEI offers an (optional) module for this, which provides such elements for various types of names.
