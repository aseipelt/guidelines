A specialized element is furnished for the capture of titlepage information.

{% include desc elem="titlePage" %}

The {% include link elem="titlePage" %} element, modelled after a similar element in Encoded Archival Description (EAD), may occur within the textual matter preceding or following the musical content of the encoding. Since a diplomatic transcription of the titlepage is often necessary to accurately identify musical material contained within a source, {% include link elem="titlePage" %} may also be used within the metadata header as a child of the {% include link elem="physDesc" %} element.
