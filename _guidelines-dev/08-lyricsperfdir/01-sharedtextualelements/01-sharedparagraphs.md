A paragraph is a structural unit of a larger text. Usually, it is typographically distinct; that is, it usually begins on a new line and the first letter of the content is often indented, enlarged, or both. This element has a similar meaning as the corresponding elements in Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and HTML.

{% include desc elem="p" %}

In MEI, a {% include link elem="p" %} is used in many different situations, including transcriptional use within a {% include link elem="titlePage" %} or descriptive purposes as in a {% include link elem="changeDesc" %}.
